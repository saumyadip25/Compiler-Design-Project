/*
Expected output : The expected output of the following program is that it will show errors where N=123.32 is declared because N is defined of integer data type and it is assigned to a float data type.Also float W =.090 will also show error because a floating point number cannot start from decimal value ‘ . ’.  0abc is also not an identifier.
